# Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

# Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

# The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
# The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
# Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

# Example



# Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day,  with a length equalling his birth month, . In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria:  and .
