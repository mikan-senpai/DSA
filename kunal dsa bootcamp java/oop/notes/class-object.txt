what is a class -> A class is a named grouped of properties and function 
A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.

When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class.
Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality. (That is, an object occupies space in memory.)

Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.
It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.


    note:   reference variables points the objects which are store in the heap memory
            reference variables are stored in the stack memory.

Instance variables ->   are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed


The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable.
Although commonly referred to as the dot operator, the formal specification for Java categorizes the . as a separator.
